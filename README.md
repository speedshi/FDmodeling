# FDmodeling

This is a wave propagation and wavefield simulation tool that can adopt arbitrary moment tensor sources and perform simulations in complex and anisotropic media.  
Code parallelized using FORTRAN+OpenMP.

## Usage
Following the examples and the documents in this repository to use this simulation tool. If you have questions, feel free to contact me.
